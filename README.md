Universal Windows Platform application for the Chatham County, GA Area Transit System

The Chatham Area Transit (CAT) system isn't too terrible for a town of less then 150,000. The main issue I hate the most is that there are no apps for the CAT system. So, this is my project while Matthew goes through town and I'm staying with friends in the D.C. area. It's also an excuse to learn C#.

* Trip Planner (most likely using Bing Transit API)

# Dreams
